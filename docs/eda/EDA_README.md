# EDA assets (H6.S1)

This folder stores plots and CSVs generated by the EDA notebook.

## How to use
1. Move the notebook to: `notebooks/production_forecast.ipynb` in your repo.
2. Keep this file as `docs/eda/README.md`.
3. Create/verify your `.env` with Snowflake credentials.
4. Open the notebook and run all cells. It will:
   - Read from Snowflake (or fallback to `docs/eda/int_annual_production_for_eda.csv`)
   - Save plots like `hist_*.png`, `total_*.png`, `top20_wells_oil.png`
   - Save CSVs such as `totals_by_year.csv`, `oil_yearly_series.csv`

## Outputs used later
- `oil_yearly_series.csv` â€” used in H6.S2 (forecasting).
